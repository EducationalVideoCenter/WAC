WAC is an open educational resource site working to bridge the urban/rural and digital equity divides. This digital media curriculum fosters dialogues among rural/urban youth, addresses project challenges in rural areas, embodies social justice/digital equity values & best practices of urban & place-based rural pedagogies. This model of digital media teaching/learning is open to be shared and contributed to by sister organizations and digital youth media educators/practitioners from urban and rural communities around the world....
