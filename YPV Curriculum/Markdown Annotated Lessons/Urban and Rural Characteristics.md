| Greater sense of anonymity                                                                                  | Everyone knows everything about each other                                                                                                                                |
| Impacts of the project are student centered. The sense of community is more dispersed.                      | Impacts of the project on a young participant may have unforeseen long-term consequences for a young person in a small community that has an long term collective memory. |
| Subjects interviewed may or may not attend film screening.                                                  | Subjects interviewed attend the film screening, which is a major community event, and have expectations about empowerment and voice                                       |
| Greater acceptance and freedom in approaches to questioning and denouncing power structures in communities. | Informed decisions must be made in questioning and denouncing power structures in communities. Power structures are more interconnected with personal relationships.      |
| Students can feel more empowered to take ownership in how they tell the story                               | The community will hold students accountable for their storytelling decisions and accuracy.                                                                               |
