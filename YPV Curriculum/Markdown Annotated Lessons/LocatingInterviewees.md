**Objective:**

-   Students will demonstrate the ability to identify interviewees related to the problem they are researching and find organizations with materials that relate to it.

**Materials/Equipment:**

-   Notes and articles from previous lesson

-   Computers with Internet access

**Warm Up: **

**Prepare to Share (5 min)**

Look at the article you discussed in small groups last lesson. Prepare to share the main idea and a potential source of information (person to interview).

**Lesson:**

**1. Whole Class Sharing (15-20 min)**

-   Ask volunteers from each group to share main points and potential sources noted in the previous lesson.

<!-- -->

-   As groups share, ask them to clarify the words, phrases or ideas as necessary.

-   Ask the students, additionally, to share their meta-cognitive process: *How did they know that this was an important idea?*

-   Ask a student to keep a running list on newsprint of points to explore and another student to create a master list of potential contacts and resources.

**2. Introduction to Internet Research (10 min)**

-   Review basic approaches to using the Internet for research:

<!-- -->

-   *What is a search engine? (Software that enables users to search the Internet using keywords. Google! is an example of a well-known search engine)*

-   *What is a URL? (Uniform Resource Locator, the unique address of any web document)*

-   *How do you refine a search? (Using more specific key words, adding quotes or + or – signs)*

-   *How do you know if the information is reliable? (Are sources listed? Who or what are they? Are resources and references included?)*

-   *How do you locate contact information for an organization or individual? (Look for contact sections of websites or use directories like whitepages.com) *

**3. Researching Potential Interviewees (15-20 min)**

-   Assign several students or small groups the task of using search engines to locate information about potential interviewees (including contact information and some credentials). In the case of personal contacts, ask their fellow classmates for phone numbers.

-   They can do this activity by using key words and refined searches based on the points of information they shared in the beginning of the lesson.

-   Make sure that students are taking careful notes regarding their research and contacts. They should write down the originating URL’s and any other source information.

**Journal:**

Were you able to use the Internet to locate potential interviewees?

Who was the most interesting potential interviewee you located through the Internet? What was the most important information that you found out about him or her?

<li><p>Due to the easier access and more flexible schedules, formal interviews may be scheduled and secured within days <em>(EVC students in a rural town have even scheduled and conducted multiple formal interviews all within the same day; something that is unrealistic to accomplish in New York)</em></p></li>
