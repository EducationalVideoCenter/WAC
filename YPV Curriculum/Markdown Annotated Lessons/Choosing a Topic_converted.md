-   Students will demonstrate ability to make a persuasive argument as they “pitch their idea.”

-   Students will become familiar with consensus decision-making.

Materials/Equipment:

-   Newsprint from “Wall Talk” Activity

**Warm Up: **

**Prepare for Pitches (10 min)**

Ask students to gather with their group to revisit the persuasive arguments they created as a group last lesson. They should make sure that all group members have a role in pitching their argument to the class.

**Lesson:**

**1. Group Presentations (25 min)**

-   Ask each group to go in front of the class and make their “pitch.” Make sure each group member takes a turn presenting about some aspect of the pitch and that it is detailed and convincing.

<!-- -->

-   After each pitch, allow students in the audience to ask questions or make (constructive) comments.

> ***Remember:** Remind them that their arguments should draw from their interest, knowledge and general relevance of the problem to peers and community members. It also should contain specific and realistic ideas for actions they can take to make a change in the problem identified.*

**2. Select the Problem Via Consensus (10 min)**

-   When all of the groups are finished pitching, tell students that they will now decide as a class on one topic, using the consensus process. The consensus process is when everyone agrees on one topic for the documentary. The advantage of deciding on the topic via this process is that everyone feels a sense of ownership and the class is not divided into winners and losers.

-   Write all potential ideas on newsprint.

-   Facilitate a discussion, allowing students time to discuss the options, but keep the discussion focused on what is the most critical problem they face, what will make the strongest documentary, rather than on personal preference.

**3. If Necessary, Vote.**

-   If the class did not come to a consensus, then it is necessary to vote.

<!-- -->

-   Start by narrowing the choices down to two main ideas by having each student vote for only one (remember, it does not have to be the one they argued for earlier in class).

-   Select the two issues with the most votes. Then ask students to vote again to determine the main problem that will be the foucs for their documentary.

**Share (5 min):**

-   Announce the final topic.

-   Give students the chance to reflect on the decision-making process and to voice their thoughts on the problem that has been selected. Remind them, however, that the group has gone through a democratic process to select this issue and that all group members now need to focus on creating a meaningful and exciting documentary, regardless of whether it was their first choice.

**Journal:**

Address the following 3 questions:

1.  What is your first, gut reaction to the final issue that has been selected?

2.  What did you like best and least about the group decision making process?

3.  What are your hopes and fears about this YPAR documentary?

<p><strong>URBAN-RURAL CURRICULUM NOTES:</strong></p>
<p><em>Once students choose the topic they want to focus on, educators will want to start thinking about the context of the community they’re working within.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If making a documentary around a sensitive or polarizing issue, what type of impact and consequences can the students’ work have within their specific community?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>For example, if exploring an issue within a small and tight knit community, what are the relationships these students have with members of the community who may take exception to, or be impacted by such an exploration?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>This is not to discourage students from choosing any topic, but a reminder that as guides and facilitators of youth activism, it is necessary that educators make students fully aware that they are accountable for the work they produce. It’s important to ask, “Why are we doing this and what is our goal?”</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a densely populated city students may feel more anonymous in the work that they are doing</p></li>
<li><p>Students may lack direct relationships with their documentary subjects/interviewees.</p></li>
<li><p>At the same time, neighborhoods or sub-communities within urban cities can have tight knit and closely connected relationships - this can make the students’ work less anonymous and with more direct implications on personal relationships</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rural:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>In a less densely populated community, there may be more awareness of the students’ work - during the process of production and on the final product</p></li>
<li><p>Relationships are more closely interconnected and exploring a community issue may have implications on students’ personal relationships</p></li>
</ul>
