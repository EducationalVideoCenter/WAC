### **_Preparation for Lesson:_**
-----------------------

### View “Preparing for Street Interviews” on the Teacher DVD (3 min)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

*Notice how the teacher uses a role-playing activity to address the role of the scout. As students learn from each other, you’ll see the progression from the first student who is unsure of how to stop someone on the street, to the second who struggles with introducing himself and the project, to the third who is more confident in his communication skills but needs to be reminded about microphone placement and the importance of not chewing gum during an interview!*

***<span class="underline">Note:</span>** One of the most exciting ways to gather information with a video camera is to conduct interviews with the ‘person on the street.’ While it may seem daunting to take your class onto the street with video cameras, by dividing into smaller groups and enlisting chaperones, the experience is manageable and will be both enjoyable and empowering for students. *

*Ideally, your students will be able to conduct interviews in a public setting. If students cannot leave school grounds, or if you are located in a rural or suburban setting where finding people to interview on the street is too difficult, they may conduct their interviews in school or on school grounds. *

*It is best if students have multiple opportunities to conduct interviews ‘on the street.’ This will give them a chance to learn from their experience and to feel more comfortable in the various crew roles so that when they conduct interviews for their final documentary they will obtain useable footage. However, if you have a shorter time frame, students may do street interviews only once.*

**Warm Up:**

**Journal Entry: (10 min)**

> Write about which shows on TV you have seen that include interviews with people on the street. Describe a few people who were interviewed, what they talked about and what they think the interviewer gained from asking strangers for their opinion on a particular topic.

<br><br>

**Lesson:**

**1. Whole Group Discussion – the Value of Street Interviews (5 min)**

-   Ask for volunteers to share their journal entries with the rest of the class.

-   After a short discussion on the value of street interviews, explain that over the next couple of classes, the students will have the opportunity to experience “hands-on” how to conduct their own street interviews. One of the most important lessons they need to learn is how to work well together as a team or a “crew.” In order to do that, they need to first learn the crew roles and how to organize themselves to shoot their interview.

**2. Review Crew Roles (5 min)**

-   Distribute the *Crew Roles* sheet and review, having different students read aloud.

-   Discuss the role of the scout and how to effectively approach people for an interview. You may wish to do a short role-play activity as seen on the DVD. Make sure students understand how to introduce themselves and their project.

**3. Two-Shot Interview Setup (20 min)**

-   Distribute the *Shot Sheet*

-   Choose three volunteers – one to be the cameraperson, one to be the interviewer and one to be the interviewee. Connecting the camera to the TV monitor, do a mock interview in front of the class to illustrate the interview setup.

-   Move the student crew into position so they demonstrate the first of the two common interview setups: a two-shot. As a Medium Shot (MS) is being demonstrated, mention to the class that the nice thing about the two-shot is that you see both the interviewer and the interviewee. Demonstrate too much, too little and appropriate amount of headroom.

-   Ask the interviewer to demonstrate how to position the microphone effectively; making sure the microphone is pointed toward the speaker’s mouth, about six to eight inches away.

-   Ask the class:

<!-- -->

-   *When would you choose a two-shot? *

-   *What is the effect of this set up?*

**4. Over-the-Shoulder Setup (20 min)**

> *Note: The point of the over-the-shoulder shot is so that the viewer can see the whole face of the interviewee while still seeing the relationship between the interviewer and interviewee.*

-   Ask for three more student volunteers for a new crew. Move them into position so they demonstrate the over-the-shoulder setup. Ask the class:

<!-- -->

-   *What is the difference between the over-the-shoulder and the two-shot setups?*

-   *When have you seen the over-the-shoulder shot?*

<!-- -->

-   Now ask the cameraperson to zoom into a Close Up (CU) over-the-shoulder. Ask the class:

<!-- -->

-   *Who is more important in an interview - the interviewer or the interviewee?* *Why?*

-   *When would you use a CU of the interviewee?*

<!-- -->

-   Have the cameraperson demonstrate quick panning back and forth so as to have a dizzying effect. Ask the class:

<!-- -->

-   *What is the problem with this camera movement?* Mention that it is ok to have the camera on the interviewee at times when the interviewer is talking. We still hear everything as long as the microphone is held in the proper position.

<!-- -->

-   Have the cameraperson demonstrate quick zooming in and out. Often students have a feeling that the viewer will be bored if they don’t vary the shots. Explain, however, that they will not be using the entire interview and therefore this should not be a concern.

-   Ask students what else needs to be considered when setting up for a street interview. Make sure they remember to consider the direction of light source to avoid backlighting.

**Share (5 min):**

> Review advantages and disadvantages of each setup. Encourage the class to try both when they conduct and shoot interviews. Remind them that the director decides the shot and tells the cameraperson what shot s/he wants.

<p><strong>URBAN-RURAL CURRICULUM NOTES:</strong></p>
<p>Street Interview Preparation may need to be adapted according to Urban / Rural</p>
<p>environments.</p>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong> Students conduct street interviews in densely populated, heavily trafficked areas</p>
<p>along a street /street corner or at a park.</p>
<p><strong>Rural:</strong> Students conduct interviews in high traffic areas such as a mall, store parking lot</p>
<p>entrances, gas stations, restaurants or driving to the nearest town to conduct interviews in</p>
<p>the downtown area. The pace of these environments is slower and they may be able to</p>
<p>include such subjects in street interviews as workers of store-fronts / restaurants / or gas</p>
<p>stations.</p>
<p><em>Note: Filming Permits and regulations may be more present in urban vs. rural areas.</em></p>
