**Before the screening:**

1. View “Final Screening” on the Teacher DVD (8 min)
====================================================

*It’s important to treat the screening as an important event by creating a comfortable screening space. EVC screenings are often held in the school cafeteria, but tables and chairs are moved to mimic a theater and refreshments are served. Notice how excited and nervous students are to screen their documentaries and to answer questions from the audience. Notice too their sense of pride and accomplishment after the screening as they receive congratulations from family members, teachers, friends and members of the community.*
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

2. Assist Students in Writing Personal Introductions
====================================================

-   Tell students that they will each post a personal introduction at the screening. Their introductions should be written in paragraph form.

-   Here are some suggestions they can use as a guideline:

<!-- -->

-   *What did you learn in the process of producing this documentary? *

-   *What did you enjoy most about the process? What was the most challenging?*

-   *How do you plan on using the skills you developed?*

-   *What other interests/talents do you have?*

-   *Anything else that you want to add that would help someone get to know you more.*

<!-- -->

-   Attach the paragraphs to posterboard or hang directly on the wall so that audience members can see them as they enter the screening. It is also a good idea to include photos of the producers next to their paragraph. Most DV cameras will allow you to take still photos or you can use a digital still camera. Using photo quality paper to print the photos will improve the quality, but is not necessary.

**3. Prepare for the Question and Answer Session**

-   Inform students that following the screening there will be a short question and answer period. This is a time for the audience to offer congratulations on a job well done and to ask the student producers about the process they have undergone as well as about their topic.

-   To prepare, students should think about the following questions:

    -   *What process did you go through to produce the documentary?*

    -   *What aspect of the production did you enjoy the most? What did you find more challenging? What surprised you the most?*

    -   *How did you choose the topic? What did you learn about it?*

    -   *What was your goal in producing this documentary? What do you hope people learn from seeing it? Do you hope to inspire some sort of action?*

    -   *How do you plan on using the skills you developed?*

    -   *Do you have ideas for other documentaries?*

-   Ask if one or two students would volunteer to facilitate the question and answer by calling on members of the audience and ensuring that different producers answer the questions.

-   Instruct all students to speak loudly when answering questions and to take turns answering questions.

**4. Purchase Refreshments **

-   If the venue and your budget allows, it makes the event even more special if refreshments are available. Purchase snacks such as popcorn or cookies, as well as drinks for the big day. Don’t forget the paper plates, cups and napkins!

**The Day of the Screening: **

**1. Deliver the Final Tape or DVD**

-   Test the final tape or DVD to make sure everything is ok before bringing it to the screening.

-   Deliver the final tape or DVD in the format requested to the technical person who is helping with the screening. (Bring a back-up copy too, just in case.)

-   Test the tape or DVD and equipment at the location to make sure everything is in working order.

**2. Prepare the Space**

-   Mount students’ personal narratives onto posterboard or around the room. If possible, include their photo next to their statement.

-   If necessary, move the furniture to accommodate the expected guests.

-   Make the refreshments available.

3. Welcome Your Guests!
=======================

-   As guests enter, give them time to read through the students’ personal narratives.

-   Introduce yourself and your students and provide a brief description of the project *OR* enlist a student to do the introduction.

**4. Screen the Documentary**

**5. Question and Answer Session**

-   Ask all student producers to come to the front of the room and introduce themselves following the screening.

-   Ask the volunteers to begin facilitating the question and answer session. During this time, the audience should be free to give feedback on the documentary as well as ask questions of the producers.

-   Make sure all students have the chance to answer at least one question.

***<span class="underline">Note:</span>** Consider making copies of the project on VHS or DVD for students to take home. They will appreciate being able to show their hard work to family and friends.*

***<span class="underline">Note</span>**: If your students are interested in reaching audiences with their films through outreach screenings, film festivals, web streaming, DVD sales and more, consult Arts Engine's Youth Media Distribution Instructors Toolkit for lesson plans and assignments on developing outreach and distribution plans (available for free download at www.ymdi.org/instructors).

<p><strong>URBAN-RURAL CURRICULUM NOTES</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Urban:</strong></p>
<p><em>Anonymous element to living in a densely populated community may provoke students to </em></p>
<p><em>feel more empowered to take ownership in how they tell the story. It is important to </em></p>
<p><em>remind students that the micro communities that exist in urban areas are often similar to </em></p>
<p><em>rural communities in the sense that everyone knows each other and the community will </em></p>
<p><em>hold each other accountable to how they are represented. </em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>A location for the screening should be reserved at least a month in advance to ensure a screening space.</p></li>
<li><p>Invitations should be sent out with at least two-three weeks anticipation so people can schedule the date in their calendar as well as send multiple reminders.</p></li>
<li><p>Email is the best method of communication to send out invitations.</p></li>
<li><p>Subjects interviewed may or may not attend film screening.</p></li>
<li><p>The screening and Q&amp;A may have less participation from the audience and be structured more like a presentation by the instructors and students.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rural:</strong></p>
<p><em>The community will hold students accountable for their storytelling decisions, accuracy </em></p>
<p><em>and representation of subjects interviewed. Throughout the project, it is important to </em></p>
<p><em>consider the purpose of the film and analyse the consequences a public screening of the </em></p>
<p><em>film will have on the community.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reserving a location for the screening may be more flexible and ensuring a screening space may be a simple task.</p></li>
<li><p>Invitations should be sent out using multiple forms of communication. Internet access is more difficult and many members of the community may not use email. An invitation list should be made thinking about the best method of communication for each invitee. Forms of communication include: Flyers to hand out personally or post in public spaces, phone calls and emails.</p></li>
<li><p>Subjects interviewed will likely attend the film screening and have expectations about empowerment and voice.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The screening and Q&amp;A may be a major event where all ages from the community attend. Since the audience may know each other, there could be more of a dialogue happen between the students and the audience. Students should be prepared to answer difficult questions about their film and listen to multiple perspectives.</p></li>
