Welcome! Willkommen! Bienvenue! Bienvenidos! Bem-vind@s!

Thank you for visiting the EVC We Are All Connected Curriculum repository!
   

### What is this about?
[Educational Video Center](https://www.evc.org), a youth media organization with over 30 years of experience making documentaries with youth is working to develop an urban-rural curriculum to bring youth across cultures and continents together to make media projects.

Our curriculum is project-based, student-centered and grounded in social justice and civic engagement. 

See the full curriculum [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1p8s9Np4YHY3WpAC7A3QsFp9WH1nGCiIX). 
 
### Why?
We need your input to develop this open curriculum as a resource to teach filmmaking in urban and rural communities around the world!!

Our urban-rural program, [We Are All Connected](https://weareallconnected.wixsite.com/weareallconnected), is currently working with youth in New York City and the Appalachian Mountain region of Tennessee to create collaborative documentary films.



### HOW CAN YOU HELP?
Thanks for your interest in contributing to [We Are All Connected](https://weareallconnected.wixsite.com/weareallconnected)! There are many ways to contribute.

There are several ways you can contribute to our open curriculum project.

Primary Goals for the Global Sprint:
1. You can start by saying ["hello" here](https://github.com/EducationalVideoCenter/WAC/issues/5) and talking a little about yourself.

2. Have you lived or worked in an urban and/or rural setting? Check out our urban and rural qualities chart. We'd love to get your evalutation and input: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MAswOOi1dCkss9z91yVW3Ie8K4TyYpJ6XqAW_AlGVxY/edit) 
or
[GitHub](https://github.com/EducationalVideoCenter/WAC/blob/master/YPV%20Curriculum/Markdown%20Annotated%20Lessons/Urban%20and%20Rural%20Qualities.md)

3. Contributors can share lesson plans, documents or other educational material you find useful in either our [GOOGLE Contributor Resource Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FZu6nEJjj0ZaGJmOw8c4chVAC5sx1FgB?usp=sharing) or our [GITHUB Contributor Resource Folder](https://github.com/EducationalVideoCenter/WAC/tree/master/Contributor%20Resource%20Folder) 


4. Contributors can provide feedback on some of our annotated urban-rural lessons via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1awuFaVIX5OQVmXiw8nV99NdoThgoI-kc) or our [Github](https://github.com/EducationalVideoCenter/WAC/tree/master/YPV%20Curriculum/Markdown%20Annotated%20Lessons) 


5. Are there any individuals or organizations that you feel we may want to learn more about? Potential collaborators? [Let us know!](#communication-channels)
