### Welcome! :smiley:

Welcome! Willkommen! Bienvenue! Bienvenidos! Bem-vind@s!

Thank you for visiting the EVC We Are All Connected Curriculum repository!
   

### What is this about?
[Educational Video Center](https://www.evc.org), a youth media organization with over 30 years of experience making documentaries with youth is working to develop an urban-rural curriculum to bring youth across cultures and continents together to make media projects.

Our curriculum is project-based, student-centered and grounded in social justice and civic engagement.  
 
### Why?
We need your input to develope this open curriculum as a resource to teach filmmaking in urban and rural communities around the world!!

Our urban-rural program, [We Are All Connected](https://weareallconnected.wixsite.com/weareallconnected), is currently working with youth in New York City and the Appalachian Mountain region of Tennessee to create collaborative documentary films.
