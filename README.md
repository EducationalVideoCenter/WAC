We Are All Connected youth media curriculum 
Bridging urban and rural divides through collaborative youth empowered media.   
## Welcome!
Welcome! Willkommen! Bienvenue! Bienvenidos! Bem-vind@s!
Thank you for visiting the We Are All Connected Curriculum repository.
This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 
## Who are we?
Based in the heart of New York City with over thirty years of experience, the Educational Video Center is an urban youth media organization interested in collaborating with rural partners in the United States and internationally to bring youth across cultures and continents together to realize a media project.

Our curriculum is project-based, student-centered and grounded in social justice and civic engagement.  Please feel free to contribute to this curriculum if you would like to share lessons, activities and urban / rural project development tips.
 
### What are we doing?
The We are All Connected open educational resource site works to bridge the urban/rural and digital equity divides. This digital media curriculum fosters dialogues among rural/urban youth, addresses project challenges in rural areas, embodies social justice/digital equity values & best practices of urban & place-based rural pedagogies. This model of digital media teaching/learning is open to be shared and contributed to by sister organizations and digital youth media educators/practitioners from urban and rural communities around the world.
 
### The Project
There is a societal urban/rural divide among communities in the United States and beyond
Young people aren’t provided enough resources, opportunities and guidance for connecting with youth from different spaces to collaboratively address issues that are meaningful to them 
Many educators may be interested in facilitating cross regional projects that connect youth, but lack the experience and guidance on how to carry out such projects  

### How can I get involved?

Contribute to our curriculum!!
Let’s do a project together!!
Help us raise funds to work partner with rural organizations and their youth!
 
The We Are All Connected Youth Media Curriculum will:

1.  Create a space for urban and rural youth to collaboratively create films and other media projects about their communities, building relationships with each other 

2.  Provide lessons and other sources of information that guide urban and rural educators from all levels of experience with film and media technology on how to facilitate collaborative youth media projects.
